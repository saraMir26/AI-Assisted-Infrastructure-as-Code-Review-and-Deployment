Overview

You have a straightforward Azure build (RG, VNet/Subnet, Public IP, NSG, NIC, Storage Account, Linux VM). There are several high-impact issues around security, governance, and tagging, and a few potential cost optimizations. Below is a structured review and suggested fixes.

1) Security risks

- Public VM exposure
  - A Standard Public IP is directly attached to the NIC, exposing the VM to the internet.
  - The NSG you created is not associated to either the NIC or the subnet, so its rules do not take effect. This can leave inbound traffic control to platform defaults and is a governance/security gap.
  - The NSG rule allows SSH (22) from 0.0.0.0/0, which is a common brute-force vector.

- VM authentication
  - No SSH key or password is configured. Terraform will fail, but if a password is added later, password-based auth is riskier than key-based. Best practice is SSH keys and disable password authentication.

- Storage account exposure
  - public_network_access_enabled = true combined with allow_nested_items_to_be_public = true materially increases the risk of accidental public data exposure.
  - Missing controls like allow_blob_public_access = false, network_rules, private endpoints, and HTTPS-only enforcement.

- Missing encryption and identity controls
  - No customer-managed keys (CMK) for disks where required by compliance.
  - No managed identity on the VM; credentials would likely be embedded elsewhere instead of using Azure AD auth to services.

- Lack of least-privilege network egress
  - No outbound restrictions (all outbound allowed by default). Consider tightening if compliance requires.

- Missing diagnostics and security posture tooling
  - No NSG flow logs or resource diagnostic settings to Log Analytics.
  - No Just-In-Time VM access (Defender for Cloud) recommendation addressed.
  - No resource locks to prevent accidental deletions.

2) Cost concerns

- Public IP
  - Standard, Static Public IPs incur monthly cost even when idle; reassess whether the VM needs direct internet exposure. If it does, consider Azure Bastion (adds cost) or a jump host behind stricter controls.

- Disk type
  - Premium_LRS for the OS disk is more expensive; use Standard SSD (StandardSSD_LRS) for dev/test unless you need performance.

- VM size
  - var.vm_size is unspecified. Right-size to the workload; consider dev/test using Spot VMs (with eviction risk) or Savings Plans/Reserved Instances for long-lived prod VMs.

- Storage replication
  - LRS is cheapest; ensure it meets durability/availability requirements. ZRS/GRS increase cost.

- Data egress
  - With a public IP, outbound internet egress can incur charges. Keep services private where possible.

3) Naming standard violations

- Names are not aligned to Azure CAF or common enterprise standards, and are not descriptive of environment, workload, or region:
  - Resource group: myrg123
  - VNet: my-vnet
  - Subnet: default-subnet
  - Public IP: my-public-ip
  - NSG: my-nsg
  - NIC: my-nic
  - VM: myvm123
  - Storage account: cloudnovapublicstore (valid syntax, but lacks standardized pattern)

- Suggested patterns (examples; adapt to your org):
  - RG: rg-<app>-<env>-<region>
  - VNet: vnet-<app>-<env>-<region>
  - Subnet: snet-<tier>-<env>-<region>
  - Public IP: pip-<app>-<env>-<region>
  - NSG: nsg-<scope>-<env>-<region>
  - NIC: nic-<vm>-<env>-<region>
  - VM: vm-<app>-<role>-<env>-<region>
  - Storage: sa<org><app><env><region><suffix> (lowercase, 3–24 chars, globally unique)

4) Missing tags

- No tags on any resources. This impacts cost allocation, lifecycle management, and policy compliance.
- Add a consistent tag set across all resources. Common keys:
  - environment, application, owner, cost_center, business_unit, data_classification, compliance, managed_by, created_by, contact, lifecycle

5) Governance issues

- Policy and compliance
  - No Azure Policy assignments to enforce secure configurations (e.g., deny public blob access, require tags, enforce HTTPS, restrict public IP on NICs).
  - No resource locks (read-only/delete) to guard critical resources.

- Identity and access
  - No managed identities for the VM, no RBAC role assignments for least privilege to dependent services (e.g., storage).

- Network governance
  - NSG is not associated to subnet/NIC; rules are not effective.
  - No service endpoints/private endpoints for storage.

- Observability
  - No diagnostic settings (logs/metrics) to Log Analytics.
  - No NSG flow logs or VM boot diagnostics.

- Backup/patching
  - No Azure Backup or patching strategy (Update Manager). Not strictly Terraform-only, but should be planned.

6) Suggested fixes

- Secure the VM access path
  - Remove the public IP from the NIC and use Azure Bastion or a jump host, or:
    - If you must keep a public IP, restrict SSH to specific source IP ranges and enable JIT access via Defender for Cloud.

- Associate the NSG
  - Attach the NSG to the subnet or NIC so rules are enforced.

- Use SSH keys and disable password auth
  - Provide admin_ssh_key and set disable_password_authentication = true.

- Harden the storage account
  - Disable public blob access and nested public items, enforce HTTPS-only, minimum TLS, and restrict network via private endpoints or network rules.

- Add tags everywhere
  - Use a common tags variable and apply tags to all resources.

- Improve naming
  - Apply consistent naming following your org’s convention.

- Add governance and diagnostics
  - Add Azure Policy assignments for secure configurations and tag requirements.
  - Send diagnostics for NSG/VNet/VM/Storage to Log Analytics.
  - Consider resource locks for critical resources.
  - Add a system-assigned managed identity to the VM.

Additional recommendations

- Consider Azure Policy assignments to enforce:
  - Require tags on resources.
  - Deny public blob/container access.
  - Enforce HTTPS-only and TLS 1.2+ on Storage.
  - Deny public IPs on NICs in production subnets.
  - Enforce NSG association on subnets.

- Plan for backups and patching:
  - Azure Backup for the VM if stateful.
  - Use Update Manager or configuration management for OS patching.

- Cost management:
  - Evaluate VM sizing and disk types regularly.
  - Consider Savings Plans/Reserved Instances for long-lived workloads.
  - Keep resources private to avoid egress.

By implementing the fixes above, you’ll materially improve security posture, governance, and cost control while aligning with common Azure standards.
